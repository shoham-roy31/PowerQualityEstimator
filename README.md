# PowerQualityEstimator
I have developed a Supervised Learning Model using Random Forest Regressor, to estimate the Power Factor in a miniature Busbar, in real-time. 
My model has successfully been able to achieve a test accuracy of 99.89% with minimal parameters involved as it will open the accessibility to every consumer with least electrical measuring devices to check power quality of their supply.
